# Software Design Principles

## Introduction

This README outlines five fundamental design principles in software engineering that guide effective and maintainable software design.

## Design Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change. To follow SRP, break down complex problems into smaller parts based on their distinct responsibilities and encapsulate each part in separate classes.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) suggests that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can extend their behavior without modifying their source code. Modules should provide extension points (like interfaces or inheritance) without requiring changes to their core implementation.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures behavioral compatibility among derived types.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) advocates for client-specific interfaces rather than general-purpose ones. It advises against "fat" interfaces that include methods not relevant to all clients. Instead, interfaces should be tailored to the precise needs of the clients to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) promotes decoupling and flexibility by emphasizing abstraction over implementation details. According to DIP, high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions. Likewise, abstractions should not depend on details but should define contracts that details (concrete implementations) must adhere to.

## Conclusion

Understanding and applying these design principles can lead to more modular, flexible, and maintainable software systems.
